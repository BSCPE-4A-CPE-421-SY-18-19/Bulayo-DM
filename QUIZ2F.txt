How did the Rasp Pi Work?

-Upon troubleshooting the raspberry Pi that was not functional,
we observed that the charger we used was'nt compatible with the raspberry Pi B, 
it's because the model B uses between 1000 mA depending on what components or peripherals are 
connected to it, since we suspected that the charger that is not compatible to the
rasp pi is the one causing the trouble, we connected another charger that is right or 
appropriate and compatible to the model and luckily, it functioned well and worked properly.
